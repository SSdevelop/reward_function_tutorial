const Step2 = () => {
    return(

            <Typography variant="h6" component="div" gutterBottom>
                Up till now, we were only using the all_wheels_on_track on track to determine 
                whether the car is on track or not. But, we can use the distance_from_center 
                and gradually decrease the reward as the car moves away from the center. 
                This will ensure that the car stays near the center of road, as much as possible.<br />
                We can do this, by assigning a reward of 1.0 if the car is at the center of the track, 
                a penalty of 0.5 if the car is at the edge of the track and a penalty of 0.25 if the 
                car is in between the center and the edge. <br />
                We can use the track width to determine these points. Conider the image below <br />
                <div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>
                    <img src={trackWidth} alt='track width' />
                </div>
                So, the center point will be the 50% of the track width. 
                The point in between the edge and center will be at 25% of the track width. 
                Similarly, we can assign the reward values for the other points. <br />
                For this Tutorial, we will be using the following marks: 50%, 25%, 10% and 0%<br />
                You can do this by adding the marker initializer from the Initializer tab. 
                It will add three markers to the code, namely <b>marker_1</b>, <b>marker_2</b> and <b>marker_3</b>.
                These will reprent the 50%, 25% and 10% point of the track respectively. Make sure to 
                initialize the markers after you have initialized <b>track_width</b>. <br />
                Initialize the markers and move to the next step.
